	\section{Major Academic Projects}
	
	\project{June 2020 - }{Present}{Introductory Resources for DFT Analysis and Synthesis}{\url{https://github.com/andrewdavis33/DFT-Guide}}
	{
		A comprehensive, introductory guide to Discrete Fourier Transform in the context of audio for musicians and programmers.  Much material
		for signal processing and Fourier analysis is too arcane for introductory students to the field of digital signal 
		processing.  This guide serves to lead newcomers through an intuitive derivation of the DFT and use a series
		of musical examples to articulate important theoretical and practical understanding.  Future work for the project
		involves creating visual demonstrations and short YouTube videos to better illustrate principles of the DFT.
	}
	
	\project{July 2018 - }{Present}{Instrument and Effect Software for the SuperCollider Platform}{\url{https://github.com/andrewdavis33/sc_library}}{
		A repository of musical instruments, synthesizers, and effects written in sclang for the SuperCollider platform.
		Examples of files range from experimental reverberators to traditional 80's synth effects.  Future work includes
		development of Fourier techniques as well as UGens for server-side processing.

	\section{Service Experience}
	\smallHeader{Wellesley College}
	
	\positionBlock{Fall 2019 -}{Present}{
		\textit{Tutoring Coordinator}:

		\textit{Curriculum Committee Member}:
		The Curriculum Committee is responsible for evaluating and amending the department's offering
		of courses.  The Curriculum Committee works with the department's Diversity and Inclusion
		Committee to asses the impact of the department's offerings on inclusion.  During my time on
		the committee, we pushed to change the introductory sequence from a two-course model to a
		three-course model to alleviate the quick pace of the sequence and to better match student's
		previous exposure with CS to the appropriate course.
	}
	
	\positionBlock{Fall 2019 -}{Present}{
		\textit{CS Advisor}: CS Advisors advise CS majors and minors by planning out course schedules,
		advising on internships, and offering advice on career paths.   I have advised 11 CS majors and minors
		during my time as a CS Advisor.
